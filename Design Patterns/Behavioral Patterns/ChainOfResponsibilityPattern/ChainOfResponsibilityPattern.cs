     * Chain of responsibility pattern is used to achieve loose
     * coupling in software design where a request from the client
     * is passed to a chain of objects to process them.
     * Later, every object in the chain will decide whether to
     * process the request and whether to pass it to the next object
     * in the chain, or not.
     *
     * It's main perk is the ease of control of the order of request handling.
     * Use the Chain of Responsibility pattern when your program is expected
     * to process different kinds of requests in various ways, but the exact
     * types of requests and their sequences are unknown beforehand.
